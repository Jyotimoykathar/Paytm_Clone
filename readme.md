- Live Site URL: [netlify.app](https://paytm-clone-with-tailwindcss.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind Css

### Time required

Nearly 4 day required to understand the tailwind doc and apply till completion.

### What I learned

This is the customize color design code snippet using tailwind css.

```js
<script>
      tailwind.config = {
        theme: {
          extend: {
            colors: {
              blueLight: "#00BAF2",
              blueShade: "#00AFE3",
              DblueShade: "#0E3E80",
              blueDark: "#0F4A89",
              lightGrey: "#F5F7FA",
              mediumGrey: "#E6E9ED",
              greyslight: "#F6F6F6",
            },
          },
        },
      };
    </script>
```

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn about tailwind css library and implement it.
Animation and JS need to be added to make the page more interactive and beautiful.

### Useful resources

- [TAILWIND](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This tailwind doc. was very helpful while creating the entire project.
- [ION ICONS](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - This is an amazing website with open source icons that helps to add icons easily to your webpages.
